Quick start guide
This section walks you through the fastest path to a running dev server. It assumes you have a modern Node.js environment and a PostgreSQL server available. If you prefer, you can adapt the steps to your existing stack.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or newer
- npm, yarn, or pnpm as your package manager (pnpm recommended for performance)
- PostgreSQL 12+ instance with a user you can configure
- Basic command line familiarity
- Optional: Docker for local database if you want an isolated environment

Download and run from the releases
From the Releases page, download the installer asset nuxtjs-boilerplate-installer.sh and run it. This installer will set up the project skeleton on your machine, install dependencies, and create initial configuration files. After the installer completes, you will have a ready-to-run project with development scripts you can start immediately. See the Releases page for more details and asset options. For quick access, the Releases page is the central place to grab the latest version and any important updates. The Releases page can be accessed here: https://github.com/SquidyLOL/nuxtjs-boilerplate/releases

- Step 1: Install dependencies
  - Open a terminal in an empty directory where you want the project.
  - If you used the installer, it will handle this step. If you prefer manual setup, navigate to the project folder and run:
    - npm install
    - or pnpm install
  - This installs the frontend and backend dependencies, configures package scripts, and ensures the TypeScript types compile cleanly.

- Step 2: Configure environment variables
  - Prepare a .env file at the project root. You will need values for the database URL, OAuth configuration, and any external services you plan to use.
  - A typical .env.sample looks like this:
    - DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname?schema=public"
    - JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_here"
    - OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
    - OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
  - Copy .env.sample to .env and customize it to your environment.
  - If you use Docker for local development, you can adapt the database URL to point to the container network.

- Step 3: Set up the database and Prisma
  - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible with the credentials in your .env.
  - Prisma migrations bring your schema into sync with the database:
    - npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  - Generate the Prisma client to ensure type-safe queries:
    - npx prisma generate
  - If you have existing data, you can seed it with a script in prisma/seed.ts and run it via npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts (adjust according to your tsconfig).

- Step 4: Run the development server
  - Start the backend API and the Nuxt frontend in development mode:
    - npm run dev
  - The command starts a local server for the API and the client app, typically on http://localhost:3000 or a port you configure.
  - If you want to run a specific part, you can use workspace scripts if provided by the boilerplate (e.g., npm run ui for frontend or npm run api for backend).

- Step 5: Verify the app
  - Open the browser and navigate to the local address shown in your terminal.
  - Check user flows: sign-up, sign-in, password reset if included, and OAuth login if configured.
  - Confirm data flows through Prisma to PostgreSQL by creating or reading records in the UI and in the database.

- Step 6: Optional enhancements
  - Set up Docker Compose to unify the app, database, and any dependent services.
  - Add a local SMTP server for testing email flows.
  - Integrate a caching layer if your app requires high read performance.
  - Wire up a CI/CD pipeline to automate tests and deployments.

- Step 7: Project health checks
  - Run ESLint to ensure code style and quality:
    - npm run lint
  - Run TypeScript checks:
    - npm run typecheck
  - Run tests if present:
    - npm test
  - Build a production bundle to verify bundling and asset optimization:
    - npm run build
  - Run the production server to validate runtime behavior:
    - npm start

Backend architecture and data layer
PostgreSQL forms the data backbone for this boilerplate. The design favors clear separation of concerns, predictable migrations, and easy data access through Prisma. The architecture emphasizes type safety, testability, and forward compatibility.

Key choices
- PostgreSQL as the primary relational database for stability and a robust feature set.
- Prisma as the ORM to provide a clean query API with a strong type system.
- Clear data models that map closely to the UI components and business logic.
- Migration-first approach for database evolution, with careful versioning of schema changes.

Data modeling philosophy
- Entities are modeled with explicit relationships and constraints for integrity.
- Each table has a primary key that‚Äôs stable across environments.
- Timestamps are used for created_at and updated_at to track changes.
- Sensitive fields are protected by access controls within the API layer.

Prisma schema design
- Put all models under prisma/schema.prisma.
- Use relations to model one-to-many and many-to-many associations.
- Generate type-safe client to minimize runtime errors and improve developer experience.
- Use migrations to carry schema changes from development to production.

Security and data protection
- Access to data is governed by API layer authorization checks.
- Sensitive fields are excluded from client responses unless explicitly allowed.
- Environment-based secrets and keys are loaded from a secure source (e.g., .env).
- Regular updates and security reviews are encouraged to keep dependencies safe.

Frontend architecture and UI
Nuxt 4 powers the frontend with a modern, modular structure. Pinia handles state management, while Tailwind CSS provides a scalable styling system. The UI is designed to be responsive, accessible, and consistent across pages.

Frontend decisions
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for fast first paint and SEO friendliness.
- Auto-imported components to reduce boilerplate.
- Pinia store modules organized by domain for maintainability.
- UI components designed to be reusable across pages and features.
- Tailwind CSS with a tailored design system to speed up styling.

Styling and theming
- Tailwind CSS is the foundation for styling.
- A design system with tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and radii is defined to ensure consistency.
- Dark mode is supported via a simple toggle in the UI and a color palette that adapts automatically.
- Accessibility considerations are baked in: semantic HTML, ARIA attributes on interactive elements, and keyboard navigation first.

OAuth and authentication
- The boilerplate includes OAuth-ready patterns for popular providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- A secure authentication flow is implemented with access tokens and refresh tokens.
- Token storage is designed to minimize exposure in the browser and support server-side session management when needed.
- Roles and permissions can be extended as your app grows.

State management and data flow
- Pinia stores manage client-side state with clear actions and getters.
- Data fetching uses a service layer that centralizes API calls and error handling.
- Caching strategies are included to optimize repeated data access and reduce unnecessary network calls.
- The dev experience benefits from strict typing for store definitions and API payloads.

Security and best practices
- ESLint enforces code quality and consistency.
- TypeScript reduces runtime surprises and improves editor feedback.
- Sensitive configuration lives in environment variables; never commit secrets.
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scans are recommended.

Quality, tests, and automation
- ESLint and Prettier enforce style and quality across the codebase.
- Unit and integration tests are encouraged for core logic and critical paths.
- A sample test setup is provided; adapt it to your testing philosophy.
- Continuous Integration (CI) recommendations are included to help you set up pipelines that run tests, linting, and builds on every push.

Development workflow
- Clone the project and install dependencies.
- Set up the environment with a .env file tailored to your environment.
- Run migrations to align the database with your Prisma schema.
- Use dedicated scripts to run the frontend and backend in development mode.
- Leverage hot-reloading for rapid iteration.
- Keep code quality high with lint and type checks as part of your daily routine.

Deployment and production
- The boilerplate supports running in production with a production-ready build.
- Separate API server and frontend rendering can be deployed behind a reverse proxy.
- Environment variables govern behavior in production. Ensure those are securely managed.
- Database migrations should be applied in a controlled manner during deployment.

Customization and advanced patterns
- Extend data models with minimal friction by updating Prisma schema and generating the client.
- Add new pages by creating route-based Vue components under the pages directory.
- Create new store modules for additional domains.
- Introduce feature flags to enable or disable features without deploying new code paths.
- Add or adjust OAuth providers as your needs evolve.

Accessibility and internationalization
- The UI includes semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for better assistive tech support.
